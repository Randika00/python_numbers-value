## python_numbers-value

The classify_number function in this program accepts an integer argument, num. Using if, elif, and else statements, the function checks 
the value of num to see if it's positive, zero, or negative. The relevant message is then printed.Following function definition, an integer
input from the user is obtained using input(), transformed into an integer using int(), and then the function classify_number is called with the 
entered number as an argument. This program will ask you to enter a number when it runs, and it will print the appropriate classification message
based on the input and the specifications you entered.  
In order to categorize an integer input as negative, zero, or positive depending on the specified conditions, this code defines the 
classify_number function, calls the classify_number function with the entered number as an argument, and returns the result.
